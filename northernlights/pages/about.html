              Tony Dress is a former major league Baseball International Coach who
              has taken teams and trained players in Norway, Sweden, Italy, Spain,
              Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Australia and New Zealand. While
              in Europe, he coordinated coaching clinics and team events for all
              ages and has set up baseball clinics for ages 8-80. His main focus
              is working with youth to develop and enhance their baseball skills
              while experience the culture exchange and team benefits between
              American and European teams.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-small">
              Tony developed the first national baseball team in Norway and
              implemented credential programs and recruited sponsors for the
              support of the international baseball federations.
            </p>

              Recently, in July 2011, he conducted a clinic and camp in Drobak,
              Norway for the Norway Midnight Sun Summer camp. It was a huge
              success. Drobak, Norway which once was the hub of softball and
              baseball has made a huge comeback. Young Norwegian boys and girls
              are anxious to fine tune their skills and share their culture while
              having interaction with an American Coach.
            </p>
